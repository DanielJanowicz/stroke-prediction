#### Notes:
- The numerical values assigned to each category are arbitrary and can be adjusted as needed. The key is consistency throughout your analysis.
- For the 'gender' column, the handling of the "Other" category depends on its significance in your analysis and the number of occurrences. If it's a rare category, assigning it as NA (or another unique value) and handling it separately might be appropriate.
- For multi-category variables like 'work_type' and 'smoking_status', the numerical encoding doesnâ€™t imply an ordinal relationship. If your model assumes an ordinal relationship, consider one-hot encoding instead.

# Stroke Prediction Model Developed in R

## Overview: 
This repository aims to evaluate the various prediction models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.) to determine which is best in measures of evaluation metrics which includes degree of accuracy, sensitivity, recall, F-score and AUC.

## Summary:
This prediction model has been brought up for the purpose of predicting stroke cases in patients due to the [increase in overall cases across the world.](https://www.who.int/srilanka/news/detail/29-10-2022-world-stroke-day-2022#:~:text=The%20Global%20Stroke%20Factsheet%20released%20in%202022,in%20stroke%20incidence%2C%2043%%20increase%20in%20deaths)  This model is created with the following data in mind: **patient data** which includes **medical history** and **demographic information**.  When this model is validated, it would be expected to be implemented in the clinicial decision support system for a healthcare organization.  This model would also be able to track high-risk patients and monitor the impact of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of stroke.  It would be expected that this model would be enhanced with a continuous data stream that would better train the machine learning model that provides the most accurate prediction.  

## Approach:
The prediction model is developed in R, specifically in RStudio.  

### System Requirements:

- [R 3.3.0+](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/code?resource=download)
- [Tidyverse Data Science Package](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

RStudio packages:
```
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
```

In the RStudio Console:
```
install.packages("packagename")
```
